# TikZ Extension For Quarto

Render [PGF/TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) diagrams in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## Installing

```bash
quarto add danmackinlay/quarto_tikz
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

Create a code block with class `.tikz`.

````qmd
```{.tikz embed_mode="link" scale=3 filename="example" format="svg"}
\node[draw, circle] (A) at (0,0) {A};
\node[draw, circle] (B) at (2,2) {B};
\node[draw, circle] (C) at (4,0) {C};
\node[draw, circle] (seven) at (5,1) {888888};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B);
\draw[->] (B) -- (C);
\draw[->] (C) -- (A);
```
````
This should appear in the output as an image

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## Render failures

Note that _if ghostscript libraries are not discoverable on your system [we will fail to render SVGs correctly](https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/)_.
Getting ghostscript installed appropriately can be fiddly on MacOS;
On recent macs [it should be sufficient to install MacTex 2023](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/663229) with the _install ghostscript dynamic library_ option checked.
Before macTeX 2023 there are workarounds involving setting the ghostscript library path.
For example if I have Apple Silicon and homebrew ghostscript installed, I can set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LIBGS=/opt/homebrew/lib/libgs.dylib
```

## PDF output

This does produce PDFs which can be included in PDF output; I wonder if we could shortcut the PDF rendering and just output as plain LaTeX in that case to integrate into the main LaTeX rendering workflow?
Iâ€™m not suite sure how to handle the TikZ libraries in that case.

Pull requests welcome.

## Efficiency

~~This filter is not particularly efficient, as it has no execution caching;~~
This filter has optional execution caching.
If you use that make sure you clean it up occasionally, as it will fill up your disk with diagrams.

A better implementation would use a language cache like other engines in quarto.
However, developing a a whole tikz language engine feels like a lot more work than I can justify for the current project.

Other optimisations might be possible.
Note that `dvisvgm` supports a cache via the `--cache` option, and that latex can be fairly good at caching if we allow the intermediate files to persist.

Pull requests for that issue also welcome.

## Credits

Created by cribbing the tricks from [knitr/inst/examples/knitr-graphics.Rnw ](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R#L348) and [quarto-d2/\_extensions/d2/d2.lua](https://github.com/data-intuitive/quarto-d2/blob/main/_extensions/d2/d2.lua).
After spending 2 days of my life getting this working, I found that [there is a worked example of a tikz filter in pandoc itself](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html#building-images-with-tikz).
