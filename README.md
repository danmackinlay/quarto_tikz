# TikZ Extension For Quarto

Render [PGF/TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) diagrams in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## Installing

```bash
quarto add danmackinlay/quarto_tikz
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

Create a code block with class `.tikz`.

````qmd
```{.tikz embed_mode="link" scale=3 filename="example" format="svg"}
\node[draw, circle] (A) at (0,0) {A};
\node[draw, circle] (B) at (2,2) {B};
\node[draw, circle] (C) at (4,0) {C};
\node[draw, circle] (seven) at (5,1) {888888};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B);
\draw[->] (B) -- (C);
\draw[->] (C) -- (A);
```
````
This should appear in the output as an image

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## Render failures

Note that _if ghostscript libraries are not discoverable on your system [we will fail to render SVGs correctly](https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/)_.
Getting ghostscript installed appropriately can be fiddly on MacOS;
On recent macs [it should be sufficient to install MacTex 2023](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/663229) with the _install ghostscript dynamic library_ option checked.
Before macTeX 2023 there are workarounds involving setting the ghostscript library path.
For example if I have Apple Silicon and homebrew ghostscript installed, I can set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LIBGS=/opt/homebrew/lib/libgs.dylib
```

## PDF output

This does produce PDFs which can be included in PDF output; I wonder if we could shortcut the PDF rendering and just output as plain LaTeX in that case to integrate into the main LaTeX rendering workflow?
Iâ€™m not suite sure how to handle the TikZ libraries in that case.

Pull requests welcome.

## Efficiency

This filter is not particularly efficient, as it has no execution caching;
A better implementation would include a whole tikz language engine.
That feels like a lot more work than I can justify for the current project.

Not that `dvisvgm` supports a cache via the `--cache` option, and that latex can be fairly good at caching if we allow the intermediate files to persist; maybe we could even exploit quarto infrastructure to do so?

Pull requests for that issue also welcome.
