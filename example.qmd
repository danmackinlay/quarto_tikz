This renders TiKZ diagrams in markdown.

::: {#fig-example .test-class}
```{.tikz  embed_mode="link" scale=3 filename="example" format="svg" }
\node[draw, circle] (A) at (0,0) {A};
\node[draw, circle] (B) at (2,2) {$\phi$};
\node[draw, circle] (C) at (4,0) {C};
\node[draw, circle] (seven) at (5,1) {888888};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B);
\draw[->] (B) -- (C);
\draw[->] (C) -- (A);
```

Rendering TikZ DAGs is easy.
